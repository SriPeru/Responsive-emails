# Responsive Emails

[Email with minimal Media Queries]

## Best Practices

1. Use simple design -> try to go with Single column layout to reduce the clutter

2. Font should be clear and easy to read - otherwise user will skip. At minimum, use 13 or 14 pixels for the text and 20-22 for the titles. This will make your email much more readable on a small screen.

3. Try to avoid hyperlinks and use big buttons to highlight, better to add tap to call to make your email friendly

4. Try to avoid images, some mail clients avoid loading images. Otherwise compress images heavily to laod faster. (mail clients need user consent to load the images, gmail caches the images)

5. Do Litmus and 'Email on Acid testing', but real device testing is always better.

6. Some of the mail clients wrongly stack <td>'s this needs more css to fix the issues.
